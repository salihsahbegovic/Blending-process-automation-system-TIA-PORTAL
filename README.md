# Blending-process-automation-system-TIA-PORTAL
Project task was to create a virtual plant in Factory I/O software whose process will be controlled using the control program (written as a ladder diagram) in TIA portal software, using a S7-PLCSIM software. Monitoring and control will be done though HMI touchscreen device that is designed and programmed in TIA portal and simulated using S7-PLCSIM software.  Operator will, using the HMI, set the parameters of the mixture â€“ ratio of ingredients, speed of tank filling, temperature of the mixture, time of mixing. Program will offer two control modes: manual in which the operator will start the next phase of the process when the last phase is finished, and automated in which the operator only has to set the parameters of the mixture and press start. It is very important, in case the operator presses the wrong button, or changes the control model, or changes the parameters of the mixture that the program and process keep on working correctly. The process can start only when all the parameters have been set correctly.
